Project Description

This project is a simple traffic signal simulator built using React. It visually represents a standard traffic light with red, yellow, and green lights that change in a timed sequence. The project demonstrates fundamental React concepts such as component-based architecture, useState for dynamic state management, and conditional rendering. The lights transition smoothly using CSS, enhancing the user interface. It serves as an educational tool for understanding how React handles real-time updates and UI changes. Ideal for beginners, this project showcases how a functional, interactive component can be created with minimal code while effectively illustrating core React principles.
